# EDA - Food Delivery Company

This project is an Exploratory Data Analysis of restaurant orders data. The goal of the analysis is to gain a better understanding of the data and maybe identify insights that can help improve the restaurants's sales and customer experience.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis is a modified version of a publicly available dataset, which has been preprocessed and cleaned for this specific project. Due to the modification, the source of the dataset cannot be provided.

The dataset contains information on restaurant orders, including the product type, quantity, order time, day of the week, month, and order ID.

## Methodology
The analysis was conducted using Python, specifically using the Pandas and Seaborn libraries for data manipulation and visualization. The analysis includes:

Exploratory data analysis
Correlation analysis
Heatmap visualization
Insights

## Files
The following files are included in this project:

eda_delivery_orders_analysis.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for the analysis and visuals.

orders.csv: data source for all the orders
delivery_time.csv: data source with the date and time an order was delivered to the customer

README.md: This file containing information about the project.

## Usage
To run the analysis, open the restaurant_orders_analysis.ipynb notebook in a Jupyter Notebook environment and run the code cells in order. The notebook contains detailed explanations of the analysis process and the code used.
